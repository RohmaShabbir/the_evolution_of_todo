## Prompt

Create a Prompt History Record for the implementation plan creation in the Console Todo Application project. The record should be placed in history/prompts/console-todo/ directory with the appropriate filename format. The title should be "create-impl-plan" and the stage is "plan". Use the PHR template from .specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md if it exists, otherwise create the record with appropriate YAML frontmatter and content.
