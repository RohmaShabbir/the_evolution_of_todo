## Prompt

Create a Prompt History Record for the implementation completion of the Console Todo Application project. The record should be placed in history/prompts/console-todo/ directory with the appropriate filename format. The title should be "complete-implementation" and the stage is "green". Use the PHR template from .specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md if it exists, otherwise create the record with appropriate YAML frontmatter and content.

## Response snapshot

Created a Prompt History Record for the Console Todo Application implementation completion in history/prompts/console-todo/ directory. Used the template from .specify/templates/phr-template.prompt.md and filled in all required placeholders with appropriate values. The file is named 1-complete-implementation.green.prompt.md following the correct naming convention for a green (implementation) stage PHR.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created PHR documenting completion of console todo implementation in the correct directory structure
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for this PHR creation task
- 📁 Files: Created history/prompts/console-todo/1-complete-implementation.green.prompt.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: None needed as this completes the PHR creation task
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully applied SDD principles by creating proper documentation for the implementation completion
